        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is an iOS class. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin.iOS development environment with either the iOS Simulator or an iOS device to run the exercise on. Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In iOS, it's fairly rare to come across applications (that aren't games) which do not use a Table View. This commonly used control lets an application display a scrollable list of data which can be manipulated and often forms the basis of master/detail views. This class will go through the basics of using Table Views, getting them into your UI, populating them with data and performing some basic customizations.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Work with built-in editing operations</li>
            <li>Add support for modern editing operations</li>
            <li>Integrate a search bar</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>
            Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS215/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS215/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <div class="objective">Support editing operations on a Table View</div>
            <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this first exercise, you will modify an existing application to turn on the built-in editing features supported by a Table View.
            </li>

            <li>
            <div class="objective">Committing editing operations</div>
            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            Next, you will finish the Table View editing support by implementing the <code>CommitEditingStyle</code> method and refresh the Table View data.
            </li>

            <li>
            <div class="objective">Add support for swipe-gesture edit actions</div>
            <a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            A relatively new feature in iOS adds support for custom "swipe" actions. In this exercise, you will update the Expense Tracker application to support custom edit actions.
            </li>

            <li>
            <div class="objective">Add support for the "pull-to-refresh" gesture</div>
            <a href="./parts/part4.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this group exercise, we will use the pull-to-refresh gesture, which is a popular addition to Table Views that display external data and get new data from the external source.
            </li>            

            <li>
            <div class="objective">Add search support to a Table View Controller</div>
            <a href="./parts/part5.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this final exercise, you will add a search bar to a Table View using <code>UISearchController</code>. 
            </li>  

            <li>
            <div class="objective">Scope your searches with a scope bar</div>
            <a href="./parts/part6.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this optional homework assignment, you will integrate some category filters in the search experience by including a Scope Bar. 
            </li>     
        </ol>
